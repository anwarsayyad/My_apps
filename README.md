# My Apps (Django)

Welcome to my Django project! This repository contains a collection of apps designed to help you learn and understand Django.

## Overview

In this project, I'm creating a variety of apps to cover different aspects of Django development. While I'm currently focusing on the backend functionality, eventually, each app will serve as a standalone component that you can explore and learn from.

## Authentication and User Management

### Frontend Integration

The login, registration, and logout functionalities have been implemented on the frontend without relying on backend API endpoints. Users can interact with these features directly through the frontend UI.

### To-Do List

The To-Do List app is the first project I've created as part of this journey. It's designed to help manage projects and tasks within them. Currently, the app is built using PostgreSQL as the database backend.

For now, only the API endpoints are available, as I'm concentrating on developing the backend logic. Here's a brief overview of the endpoints you can explore:

- **GET /api/tasks/**: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
- **POST /api/tasks/**: Create a new task.
- **GET /api/users/**: Retrieve a list of all users.
- **POST /api/users/**: Create a new user.
- **GET /api/project/**: Retrieve a list of all projects.
- **POST /api/project/**: Create a new project.
- **GET /api/teams/**: Retrieve a list of all team members.
- **POST /api/teams/**: Create a new team member.
- **GET /api/comments/**: Retrieve a list of all comments.
- **POST /api/comments/**: Create a new comment.

Feel free to explore these endpoints and stay tuned for updates as I continue to develop more features for this app!

Thank you for joining me on this journey into Django development. Happy coding!
